Hello, and welcome to THEYNIX! This is a brief guide to our implementation of
the Yalnix operating system.


FILES:
CVar.c
    Implementation of helper methods for condition variable initiation and reclamation.

CVar.h
    Struct and function prototypes for condition variables.

Kernel.c
    Kernel startup function implementations (i.e. SetKernelData() and KernelStart()). Also
    contains code for kernel heap management (SetKernelBrk()) and context switching. Some helper
    function implementations found here are used both at kernel startup, in creating the init
    and idle processes, and forking.

Kernel.h
    Global variables for the kernel and prototypes for helper methods used throughout kernel.

List.c
    Linked list implementation of a list API used throughout the operating system for
    purposes such as process queues and synchronization data structure book keeping.

List.h
    Structs and function prototypes for the list API.

LoadProgram.c
    Adapted from template.c. Implementation of a function for initializing a process's user
    address space with the program text and arguments.

LoadProgram.h
    Function prototype for LoadProgram().

Lock.c
    Implemenation of helper methods for lock initiation and reclamation.

Lock.h
    Struct and function prototypes for locks.

Log.h
    Compiler definitions for kill signals, return values (i.e. SUCCESS), and logging levels.

Makefile
    Compilation scripts for the operating system.

PCB.c
    Function implementations for creating new PCBs with their internal data structures initialized
    and, optionally, the kernel stack frames allocated.
