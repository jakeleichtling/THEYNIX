#
#	Sample Makefile for Yalnix kernel and user programs.
#	
#	Prepared by Sean Smith and Adam Salem and various Yalnix developers
#	of years past...
#
#	You must modify the KERNEL_SRCS and KERNEL_OBJS definition below to be your own
#	list of .c and .o files that should be linked to build your Yalnix kernel.
#
#	You must modify the USER_SRCS and USER_OBJS definition below to be your own
#	list of .c and .o files that should be linked to build your Yalnix user programs
#
#	The Yalnix kernel built will be named "yalnix".  *ALL* kernel
#	Makefiles for this lab must have a "yalnix" rule in them, and
#	must produce a kernel executable named "yalnix" -- we will run
#	your Makefile and will grade the resulting executable
#	named "yalnix".
#

#Targets for different makes
# all: make all changed components (default)
# clean: remove all output (.o files, temp files, LOG files, TRACE, and yalnix)
# count: count and give info on source files
# list: list all c files and header files in current directory
# kill: close tty windows.  Useful if program crashes without closing tty windows.
# $(KERNEL_ALL): compile and link kernel files
# $(USER_ALL): compile and link user files
# %.o: %.c: rules for setting up dependencies.  Don't use this directly
# %: %.o: rules for setting up dependencies.  Don't use this directly
